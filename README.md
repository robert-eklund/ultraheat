# Ultraheat

Script to read information from Landis+Gyr Ultraheat (T550)

With this script you can read a telegram from a Landis&Gyr Ultraheat T550 that is used by district heating companies, such as 'Tekniska Verken' in Link√∂ping.

## Installation and usage:
This script uses a optical probe (IEC 62056-21) on an USB port to read the telegrams from the meter.

## Configuration - Docker Compose

### Docker compose
This Docker image will send the values to Home Assistant in kW, using MQTT.

Make sure to update ULTRAHEAT_MQTT_BROKER and ULTRAHEAT_USB_DEVICE

## Note:
My meter is connected to 220V so I read every minute.
If your meter is battery powered, then you should read much more seldom to avoid
draining the battery.

## Requirements:
- An optical probe (IEC 62056-21 standard) to place on the meter, for example: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01B8N0ASY/ref=pe_3044161_185740101_TE_item
- Docker
- Home Assistant
